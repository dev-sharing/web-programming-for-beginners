## 0001 Why I am starting this channel?

- I like to share knowledge and teach people.
- Instead to explain each time same thing again and again I decided to create one huge video series.
- I will try to create new learning approach.
- Without extra information only most needed and simple stuff.
- First I will start with Web development and after that with more complex and advanced topics.

## 0002 Needed Skills To Become Programmer 
- If money are you main goal this can be tricky and sooner or later you will hate what you working
- First try for 2 or more weeks and then decide to continue or not with programing.
- If you file satisfactions and joy this is you job most probably
- Willingness to learn every day, to be stubborn and try to not quit easily.
- Time spent in front of computer need to fly fast
- Regular practice and need to realise that each small step is a victory.
- Take time to understand and analyze how things work in programing and try to remember small parts from terminology. 
All this new words will be learn and easily remembered after more practice.
- You need to be organized and consistent.
- You don't have to be super clever with mathematics and algorithms!!!
- Algorithms are useful when you need to create low level stuff and optimized code to make better performance.
- No need to remember each code block , this is absurd and often you need to search via google.com for code snippets and best practices
- Give yourself time for relax. This will increase you memorization effect!
- Skipping relax will bring you to: 
-- Burnouts and mental health problems and lack of motivations.
